Aloha. My name is Jon. I am a British programmer. I sporadically update a [blog](/posts) on a range of topics (but usually programming & games).

I work as a Software Development Engineer at Amazon in London, UK. You can check my full [resum√©](/resume) if you'd like more information about my background and experience.
